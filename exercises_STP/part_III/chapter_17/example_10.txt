in Bash!!!

#  *  - adds repetition to regular expresion
        in this case it makes the program find 
        in string letters tw followed by multi o letters.

    $ echo two twoo not too. | grep - o two*


#  .  - in regular expression this symbol matches any character

    $ echo __hello__there | grep -o __.*__


#  *  is greedy, will try to match as much text as it 
        can.

    $ echo __hi__bye__hi__there | grep -o __.*__

    >__hi__bye__hi__
