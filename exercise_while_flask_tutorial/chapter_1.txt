1. Creating a directory for my project:
    (!!!allweys be sure you are in the right directory, 
    before proceed!!!)
    
    $ mkdir [my_project]

2. Setting up virtual environment for the project:
    (change directory to [my_project] if needed)

    $ python3 -m venv venv
        (I ask python to run venv package which create 
         a virtual environment called venv)

    $ virtualenv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate 
        (to activate virtual environment)

    $ deactivate
        (to deactivate virtual environment)

3. Create application:
    
    - change directory to [my_project]
    - in [my_project] create directory  app
    - in [app] create python file named  __init__

    $ touch [app]/__init__.py

        -  in [__init__] import Flask module
        - create variable [app] to which 
          assign Flask object as general variable __name__
        - to prevent circular imports in last line, 
          import routes (which don't exist yet) from
          [app]

        -
