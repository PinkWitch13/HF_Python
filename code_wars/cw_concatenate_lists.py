""" Write a function append, that, given two list l and r, 
    concatenate them into one list.
    For example, append [1,2,3] [2,4,7] = [1,2,3,2,4,7]
    The problem is really easy, basically the functional 
    world equivalent of hello world.There're at least four 
    approach, including:

1:calling one of the basic function
2:pattern match explicitly and recurse
3:use fix point combinator
4:use foldl/foldr(yes, either of them can do the job)  """
